    "My project is a chatbot named Happyella that takes the user through a personality quiz, asking them questions about their personality type and prompting the user to answer with either True or False. They introduce themselves and ask for the user's name to allow them to feel heard. The chatbot will then prompt them to start the quiz and give the user an option to quit anytime. The quiz will go through 10 questions in order and all questions must be answered to calculate the unique quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot will calculate the amount of times the user says true or false and use this number to calculate a personalized inspirational quote for the user. The chatbot then implements a feedback system to ask the user if they are satisfied with their quote, then prompts the user to end the chat and come back next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chatbot is unique in the way that it acts more like a quiz then a chatbot, as each action will happen in the same order no matter what person is interacting with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chatbot will hopefully give the user inspiration and happiness, adding a personal touch to their quote, allowing them to feel special. Ideally this chatbot will brighten the user's day with encouragement that will make them happy."

    "2. In my project, I included more than 3 original functions, as I extensively adapted a function from an assignment/lecture notes. I also included tests for more than 3 functions, and I added documentation for more than 3 functions. I also added documentation for my test functions. I also did extra research on my topic to choose questions that would accurately understand aspects of the user's personality as well as quotes that would fit their personality. Finally, I uploaded my project to GitHub."
